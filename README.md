This repository is from a job that I've done for the company I used to work on. The name of the company is Kuba Inteligência da Informação, and you can have more info/contact here: https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuba-intelig%C3%AAncia-da-informa%C3%A7%C3%A3o/

The project was coded for a cleaning products company named Mbaquimica. The system has the next functions:

    Register products
    Post blog news
    Create categories for the products
    Showcase for clients and retailers

The idea of the client was not to create a webstore, only a showcase of the products they have to recruit new retailers.

The system is in use by the company on the URL: http://mbaquimica.com.br/ But I don't support it anymore since I'm no longer part of the company (Kuba Inteligência) anymore. The code presented here in the repo was done by me, everything else that has been added or removed on the production site was done by the current dev team of Kuba.

Technologies used:

    PHP
    JavaScript
    Laravel
    BootStrap (with Paper Kit)
    MariaDB
